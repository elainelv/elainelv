My name is **Yina Lv(吕熠娜)**, I work at City University of Hong Kong (CityU) as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** now in Hong Kong, China.

I received the B.S. degree in Computer Science from Ning'bo University and Ph.D. degree in Computer Software and Theory from East China Normal University (ECNU) in the group of [Liang Shi](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s16/sl2_13905/main.psp).

I major in Computer Science and Technology. Specifically, I specialize in the QoS of high-density flash storage systems.
My research interests include NAND flash memory and computer architecture.
I have published 18 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9F9NYH4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Felainelv%2Felainelv.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the international conferences/journals such as HPCA, DAC, TCAD, ICCD, GLSVLSI, NAS, etc.

I am open-minded and a girl with positive attitude. In my spare time, I like listening to music, watching reality shows or comedies. Playing sports and games are also the choice to relax myself!
