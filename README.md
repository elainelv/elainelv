My name is **Yina Lv(吕熠娜)**, I work at City University of HongKong as a postdoc now in HongKong, China.

I received the B.S. degree in Computer Science from Ning'bo University and Ph.D. degree in Computer Software and Theory from East China Normal University in the group of [Liang Shi](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s16/sl2_13905/main.psp).

I major in Computer Science and Technology. Specifically, I specialize in the QoS of high-density flash storage systems.
My research interests include NAND flash memory and computer architecture.

I am open-minded and a girl with positive attitude. In my spare time, I like listening to music, watching reality shows or comedies. Playing sports and games are also the choice to relax myself!
